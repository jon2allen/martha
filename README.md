# martha

Project to learn flask and some mysql.

1)  Data for recipes was retrieved from Martha Stewart Living website.

/martha/sql/ - these are mysql dumps

Create a database 'martha'  - then import the mysqldump - it will create table recipe.

2) to run the flask application - put in your userid/password for mysql into run_flash_sample.sh

TODO:

Add tools used to parse the data from web.

Add some setup tools to automate shell scripts and load the db.


Best to load this on lamp virtual machine.  Uses something like Python 3.7.
